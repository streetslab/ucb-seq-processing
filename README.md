## Running Jupyter Notebooks
The .txt file contains a comprehensive list of packages that will allow one to run the Jupyter notebook attached, assuming references to locations of uCB-seq .rds files are rewritten. A full Packrat snapshot is in the works, but the text file contains all required information.
